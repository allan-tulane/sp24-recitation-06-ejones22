- **2)** recurrence: W(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) +1
  -  O(2^n)

- **3)** recurrence: S(n) = S(n-1) +1
  -  O(n)

- **4)** count shows the computations done for each sequence, there are a lot of duplicate numbers before the final sequence is acheived.

- **6)** maximum n times
  - work = O(n)
  - span = O(n)

- **8)** maximum n-2 times
  - work = O(n)
  - span = O(n)
